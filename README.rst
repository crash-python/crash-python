crash-python
============

.. start-introduction

crash-python is a semantic debugger for the Linux kernel.  It is meant to
feel familiar for users of the classic
`crash <https://github.com/crash-utility/crash.git>`_ debugger but allows
much more powerful symbolic access to crash dumps as well as enabling an API for
writing ad-hoc extensions, commands, and analysis scripts.

Installation
------------

.. start-installation

`Crash-python <https://github.com/crash-python/crash-python>`_ is on `GitHub <https://github.com>`_.

It requires the following components to work successfully:

- `Python <https://python.org/>`_ 3.6 or newer
- `pyelftools <https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools>`_
- `libkdumpfile <https://github.com/jeffmahoney/libkdumpfile/tree/add_from_pointer_classmethod>`_ with the kdumpfile.from_pointer method to allow cloning native kdump contexts.
- `GDB <https://github.com/crash-python/gdb-python/tree/gdb-12.1-target>`_ with python extensions and built with Python 3.6 or newer.

If you are using a SUSE or openSUSE release, pre-built packages are available on the `Open Build Service <https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/jeff_mahoney:/crash-python/>`_.

.. end-installation

Quick start
-----------

.. start-quick-start

Crash-python requires the following to run properly:

- The complete debuginfo for the kernel to be debugged, including modules
- The ELF images for the kernel and all modules
- The vmcore dump image from the crashed system

To start:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pycrash [options] <path-to-vmlinux> <path-to-vmcore>

Since different systems and users place these files in different locations, there are number of command-line options to locate them. On a typical SUSE system, if you have the kernel-default and kernel-default-debuginfo packages installed, you will not need to provide any additional options.

If you have expanded the RPMs separately into a different directory, you can start with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pycrash -r /path/to/root <path-to-vmlinux> <path-to-vmcore>

If youâ€™re debugging a kernel that you built from a source tree directly and installed using make INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install install, you can specify your build directory as a source for debuginfo:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pycrash -b /path/to/build/dir <path-to-vmlinux> <path-to-vmcore>

The full options are documented with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pycrash --help

.. end-quick-start
