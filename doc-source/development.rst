Documentation is automatically built from the python code for the user
guide, command help text, and API reference.

There are several make targets to assist in your development efforts:

- ``make`` or ``make all``  -- Start fresh, build the python code
  and documentation, and then run the standalone test suite.

- ``make doc`` -- Build all documentation (html, text, and man page).

- ``make doc-help`` -- Build only the documentation required for help text

- ``make doc-html`` -- Build the user manual

- ``make man`` -- Build the man page

For testing, see the :doc:`testing` section.

To develop a command, see the :mod:`crash.commands` API.
